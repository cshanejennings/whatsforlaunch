What's For Launch is a collection of current best practices for creating NodeJS
based web applications deployed through the cloud.

The goals of the project are to reduce decision fatigue and re-thinking the process
of app creation in as many aspects as possible.  This is an opinionated project
and will do it's best to make as many decisions about the application architecture
as possible without limiting what the application is capable of.

As a very rough list for the first commit, the stack is expected to be as follows:

Client JS frameworks:
React
Redux
Lodash
Font-awesome

Backend JS frameworks
HappiJS
Knex

Infrastructure / deployment
Docker
AWS

We'll also try to include some other things like how to get started with QA and
continuous integration, operations management, Agile / Scrum, etc. to include as
many things as possible to get the project started right and as inexpensively as
possible while preserving the option to scale.
